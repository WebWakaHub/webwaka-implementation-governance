# ORGANELLE IMPLEMENTATION STANDARD

---

## I. Purpose of This Standard

This standard defines the execution framework for implementing Organelles within the WebWaka Biological Architecture. It operationalizes the constitutional principles defined in ORGANELLE_LAYER_CONSTITUTION.md and ORGANELLE_CATEGORY_UNIVERSE.md, ensuring that all Organelle implementations maintain structural integrity, constitutional compliance, and architectural coherence.

This standard is mandatory for all Organelle implementations and serves as the binding execution discipline that prevents structural drift, ensures invariant preservation, and maintains the integrity of the Organelle Layer.

---

## II. Organelle Definition Requirements

Every Organelle implementation must specify the following elements:

### Canonical Category

The Organelle must be assigned to exactly one of the 18 canonical Organelle categories as defined in ORGANELLE_CATEGORY_UNIVERSE.md.

### Formal Definition

A precise, unambiguous definition of what the Organelle is and what it does.

### Responsibilities

An explicit enumeration of the Organelle's responsibilities within its category.

### Explicit Exclusions

An explicit enumeration of what the Organelle does NOT do, preventing scope creep and category contamination.

### Inputs

The data, events, or signals the Organelle accepts.

### Outputs

The data, events, or signals the Organelle produces.

### Invariants

Structural and behavioral invariants that must hold at all times.

### Failure Modes

Anticipated failure scenarios and their handling mechanisms.

### Security Considerations

Security constraints, threat models, and mitigation strategies relevant to the Organelle.

### Observability Hooks

Mechanisms for monitoring, logging, tracing, and debugging the Organelle's behavior.

### Dependency Map

Dependencies on other Organelles. Dependencies are allowed only within the same category.

### Versioning Strategy

The Organelle's versioning approach, including backward compatibility guarantees.

## V. GitHub Task Decomposition Model

### Issue Hierarchy

Organelle implementations must follow this GitHub issue structure:

**Parent Issue → Organelle**  
The parent issue represents the entire Organelle implementation.

**Child Issues → Phases**  
Each phase (0-6) is represented as a child issue.

**Subtasks → Atomic Work Units**  
Each phase is decomposed into atomic work units as subtasks.

### Issue Labeling

All issues must use the following labels:

- `layer:organelle` — Indicates Organelle Layer
- `type:implementation` — Indicates implementation work
- `phase:0` through `phase:6` — Indicates the specific phase

### Issue Template

```markdown
# [Organelle Name] — [Phase Name]

**Category:** [Category]  
**Phase:** [Phase Number]  
**Responsible Agent:** [Agent]

## Objectives

- [Objective 1]
- [Objective 2]

## Required Artifacts

- [Artifact 1]
- [Artifact 2]

## Verification Gate

- [ ] [Gate criterion 1]
- [ ] [Gate criterion 2]

## Dependencies

- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]
```

---

## VI. Verification & Constitutional Gates

### Mandatory Verification Checks

No merge is permitted without the following validations:

#### Invariant Validation

All structural and behavioral invariants must be validated before merge.

#### Cross-Category Dependency Check

No cross-category dependencies are permitted. All dependencies must be within the same Organelle category.

#### Business Logic Check

Organelles must not contain business logic. Business logic belongs to higher layers (Organ, System).

#### UI Logic Check

Organelles must not contain UI logic. UI logic belongs to presentation layers outside the biological architecture.

#### Deployment Logic Check

Organelles must not contain deployment logic. Deployment logic belongs to infrastructure layers outside the biological architecture.

---

## VII. Parallelization & Dependency Rules

### Parallel Execution Rules

**Parallel allowed:** Multiple Organelles may be implemented in parallel within the same phase, provided they have no dependencies on each other.

**Parallel prohibited:** Cross-phase execution is not permitted. Phase N+1 may not begin until Phase N is complete and verified.

### Phase Sequencing

Phases must be executed in order: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.

**No skipping phases is permitted.**

---

## VIII. Agent Role Assignment Model

### Agent Responsibilities

**webwakaagent3 — Architecture**  
Responsible for Phases 0 and 1 (Specification and Design).

**webwakaagent4 — Implementation**  
Responsible for Phases 3 and 5 (Implementation and Documentation).

**webwakaagent5 — Verification**  
Responsible for Phases 2 and 4 (Internal Validation and Verification).

**webwakaagent1 — Governance Validation**  
Responsible for governance compliance validation across all phases.

**webwaka007 — Ratification**  
Responsible for Phase 6 (Ratification).

---

## IX. Definition of Done

An Organelle implementation is considered complete when:

- **All invariants validated:** Every structural and behavioral invariant has been validated
- **All exclusions respected:** The Organelle does not violate any exclusion boundaries
- **All dependency constraints validated:** All dependencies are within the same category
- **Audit passed:** The implementation has passed formal structural audit
- **Documentation complete:** All required documentation is complete and accurate
- **Ratified:** The Founder has ratified the implementation

---

## X. Structural Drift Prevention Mechanisms

### Drift Detection Triggers

Structural drift is detected through:

- Periodic audits
- Automated invariant validation
- Dependency graph analysis
- Category boundary monitoring

### Violation Escalation Process

When a violation is detected:

1. **Immediate notification** to responsible agent
2. **Freeze** of affected work
3. **Audit** to assess violation severity
4. **Escalation** to webwakaagent1 (Governance) and webwaka007 (Founder)

### Rollback Authority

webwaka007 (Founder) has authority to order rollback of any implementation that violates constitutional invariants.

### Freeze Protocol

When a violation is detected, the affected repository or branch is immediately frozen until the violation is resolved.

---

## XI. Ratification Statement

This Organelle Implementation Standard is hereby ratified as the mandatory execution framework for all Organelle implementations within the WebWaka Biological Architecture.

All Organelle implementations must comply with this standard. Non-compliance constitutes a constitutional violation.

**Status:** RATIFIED  
**Authority:** Founder

## XII. LSVR-01A Blueprint Reconciliation Note — 2026-02-20

Following the completion of LSVR-01 (Organelle Layer Verification), a naming drift was identified between 4 governance blueprint entries and the verified repository state in `webwaka-organelle-universe`. This section formally resolves that drift.

**Repository naming is declared the canonical source of truth.** Governance documentation has been updated to match the repository. The following name corrections were applied:

| Old Blueprint Name (Retired) | Canonical Repository Name (Authoritative) |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ORG-CP-COMPUTATION_PROCESSOR-v0.1.0` | `ORG-CP-POLICY_DEFINITION-v0.1.0` |
| `ORG-GV-GOVERNANCE_VALIDATOR-v0.1.0` | `ORG-TB-BOUNDARY_CONTEXT-v0.1.0` |
| `ORG-IA-IDENTITY_ACCESSOR-v0.1.0` | `ORG-IA-SUBJECT_REGISTRY-v0.1.0` |
| `ORG-ST-STATE_MANAGER-v0.1.0` | `ORG-ST-TRUST_ASSERTION-v0.1.0` |

**Declarations:**

- Repository naming is declared canonical source of truth.
- Governance blueprint updated to match repository.
- No structural mutation occurred.
- No issue renaming was performed.
- Structural integrity of `webwaka-organelle-universe` is preserved (18 structures, 522 issues, all COMPLETE).
- This reconciliation resolves naming drift only.

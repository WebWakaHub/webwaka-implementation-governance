## SECTION I — PURPOSE

This document defines the constitutional protocol governing full horizontal industrialization of the complete WebWaka biological stack.

It authorizes structured, layer-by-layer bulk issue tree generation for all canonical structures across:

- Organelle Layer
- Cell Layer
- Tissue Layer
- Organ Layer
- System Layer
- Organism Layer

This protocol ensures:

- Controlled generation
- No premature activation
- No phase advancement
- No structural drift
- No invariant violation
- No cross-layer desynchronization

This document authorizes structural generation only.
It does NOT authorize execution or activation.

Authority: Founder (webwaka007)

## SECTION II — INDUSTRIALIZATION SCOPE

The full horizontal stack consists of:

Layer 1 — 18 Organelles  
Layer 2 — 13 Cells  
Layer 3 — 8 Tissues  
Layer 4 — 58 Organs  
Layer 5 — 18 Systems  
Layer 6 — 1 Organism  

Total Structures: 116

Each structure must be industrialized using:

- 1 Master Issue
- 7 Phase Issues (P0–P6)
- Minimum 21 Atomic Tasks (3 per phase)

Total Issues Per Structure: 29

All issue trees must be complete before moving to next layer.

---

## SECTION III — GENERATION ORDER LOCK

Generation must follow strict bottom-up order:

1. Complete all Organelles
2. Complete all Cells
3. Complete all Tissues
4. Complete all Organs
5. Complete all Systems
6. Complete Organism

No layer may begin generation until previous layer is 100% complete.

---

## SECTION IV — DORMANT STATE MANDATE

All generated issues MUST:

- Be labeled: state:dormant
- Not be labeled approved
- Not be labeled in-progress
- Not tag any agents
- Not trigger execution

No state transition permitted during bulk generation.

---

## SECTION V — LABEL DISCIPLINE

All issues must use canonical labels:

Layer Labels:
- layer:organelle
- layer:cell
- layer:tissue
- layer:organ
- layer:system
- layer:organism

Type Labels:
- type:master
- type:specification
- type:design
- type:validation
- type:implementation
- type:verification
- type:documentation
- type:ratification

Phase Labels:
- phase:0 through phase:6

State Label:
- state:dormant ONLY

No additional execution labels permitted.

---

## SECTION VI — TRACKER EXPANSION RULE

MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER must be expanded to register:

- Structure ID
- Layer
- Domain (if applicable)
- Activation Status = dormant
- Current Phase = 0
- Synchronization Floor = 0
- Dependency Integrity Score
- Vertical Stack Complete Flag

Tracker must reflect structural creation only.

---

## SECTION VII — FAILURE & ROLLBACK RULE

If during bulk generation:

- Duplicate identifiers detected
- Cross-layer dependency violation detected
- Circular dependency detected
- Domain contamination detected
- Invariant breach detected

Then:

- Entire current layer generation must stop
- Layer enters suspended state
- Manual audit required before continuation

No partial layer completion permitted.

---

## SECTION VIII — ACTIVATION PROHIBITION

This protocol does NOT authorize:

- Domain Activation Token issuance
- Phase advancement
- Execution start
- Agent tagging
- Cross-domain linking
- Deployment logic
- Infrastructure definition

Structural preparation only.

---

## SECTION IX — COMPLETION STATE

Upon completion:

- All 116 structures must exist
- All issue trees complete
- All labeled state:dormant
- No frozen entries
- No blocked entries
- Tracker fully synchronized

System enters:

"Full Structural Dormant Universe State"

---

## SECTION X — HARD STOP

This document authorizes structural generation only.

It does NOT authorize execution.

Deviation from this protocol triggers constitutional freeze.

## SECTION XI — RATIFICATION STATEMENT

Status: RATIFIED  
Authority: Founder  
Date: 2026-02-19  
Constitutionally binding.

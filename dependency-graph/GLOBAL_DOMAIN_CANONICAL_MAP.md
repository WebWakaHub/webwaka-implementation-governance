_content="""# GLOBAL DOMAIN CANONICAL MAP

---

## SECTION I — DOMAIN DERIVATION PRINCIPLE

Domains are derived from the 18 Canonical Categories, the Organ Layer Business Capability Rule, the System Layer Platform Coherence Rule, and the Organism Layer Evolution Control Model. A Domain represents a coherent business capability space, may contain multiple Organs, and must not overlap another domain’s capability scope, redefine lower-layer primitives, or collapse cross-domain boundaries.

# CSRE-01: Canonical Structural Rebase Event (Dual-Invariant Constitution)

**ID:** CSRE-01
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Authority:** Founder, WebWaka
**Subject:** Formal Adoption of the Dual-Invariant Constitutional Model

---

## SECTION I — Constitutional Authority

This Canonical Structural Rebase Event (CSRE-01) is executed under the authority vested by the Founder and is guided by the principles and findings established in the following constitutional and audit documents:

- **AI_COGNITIVE_FABRIC_CONSTITUTION.md**: Establishes the foundational governance for AI integration.
- **ORGANELLE_CANONICAL_EXPANSION_AMENDMENT_PROTOCOL.md (GAD-01)**: Sets the precedent for constitutional amendments to expand the canonical baseline.
- **ASCA-01 (AI Structural Classification Audit)**: Provides the definitive classification of AI artifacts as a hybrid of independent structures and an overlay fabric, mandating a dual-invariant model.
- **STRICT_INFRASTRUCTURE_NEUTRAL_IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT.md**: Enforces the separation of biological and runtime planes.

This protocol constitutes a formal, binding amendment to the WebWaka constitutional framework.

## SECTION II — Structural Rebase Declaration

Effective immediately, WebWaka formally adopts the **Dual-Invariant Constitutional Model** as the single source of truth for structural composition. This model resolves the ambiguity discovered in FARA-03 and ASCA-01 by defining two separate but co-equal structural invariants:

### 1. The Biological Invariant

- **Total Canonical Biological Structures:** 138
- **Mathematical Invariant:** `138 structures × 29 issues = 4,002 canonical issues`
- **Composition:** 132 previously ratified structures plus 6 newly ratified AI-native biological structures (3 Cell, 2 Tissue, 1 System).

### 2. The Runtime Invariant

- **Total Canonical Runtime Structures:** 18
- **Mathematical Invariant:** `18 structures × 29 issues = 522 canonical issues`
- **Composition:** 14 previously ratified structures plus 4 newly ratified AI-native runtime adapters.

---

## SECTION III — Ratified AI-Native Canonical Structures

The following 10 AI-native structural families, having been found by ASCA-01 to be fully industrialized and compliant with the 29-issue invariant, are hereby declared **CANONICAL** and are formally integrated into their respective baselines:

**A. Ratified Biological Structures (6):**

1.  `CEL-AI-COGNITIVE_CELL-v0.1.0`
2.  `CEL-AI-INFERENCE_CELL-v0.1.0`
3.  `CEL-AI-STREAMING_CELL-v0.1.0`
4.  `TIS-AI-COGNITIVE_TISSUE-v0.1.0`
5.  `TIS-AI-ENTITLEMENT_TISSUE-v0.1.0`
6.  `SYSX-AI-COGNITIVE_FABRIC-v0.1.0`

**B. Ratified Runtime Structures (4):**

1.  `RUNTIME-ADAPTER-AI-v0.1.0`
2.  `RUNTIME-ADAPTER-AI-CACHE-v0.1.0`
3.  `RUNTIME-ADAPTER-AI-KEYSTORE-v0.1.0`
4.  `RUNTIME-ADAPTER-AI-ROUTER-v0.1.0`

## SECTION IV — Cognitive Appendix Standard

A new governance rule is established to manage the cognitive overlay fabric. **Cognitive Appendix Issues** are formally defined as follows:

- **Nature:** Appendices are advisory modeling artifacts, not structural units.
- **Exclusion:** They are permanently excluded from all structural and invariant mathematics.
- **Constraints:** Appendices are constitutionally forbidden from:
    - Mutating domain state.
    - Altering the canonical invariant.
    - Introducing new persistence layers.
    - Creating dependency cycles.
- **Expansion Control:** The number of appendices is strictly bounded to prevent uncontrolled drift. The maximums are:
    - **10** per Organ structure.
    - **5** per System structure.
    - **5** per Organism structure.

---

## SECTION V — Certification Rebase

All prior structural certifications are superseded. The new, authoritative baselines are:

| Baseline   | Old Count         | New Count         |
| :--------- | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| Biological | 132 × 29 = 3,828  | **138 × 29 = 4,002**  |
| Runtime    | 14 × 29 = 406     | **18 × 29 = 522**     |

- **Total Structural Invariant:** `4,002 (Bio) + 522 (Runtime) = 4,524 canonical issues`
- **Cognitive Appendix Issues:** 655 (Excluded from invariant)

---

## SECTION VI — Governance Drift Closure

This rebase event formally resolves all structural drift identified in FARA-03 and ASCA-01. There are no remaining shadow structures or unclassified AI artifacts within the repositories. The Dual-Invariant Model is declared the permanent and immutable framework for all future structural governance.

---

## SECTION VII — Activation Discipline Preservation

It is explicitly declared that this constitutional rebase event **DOES NOT** authorize, trigger, or imply readiness for platform activation. This protocol is a governance-only action. It does not alter issue states, mutate labels, or trigger any implementation or operational workflows.

## SECTION VIII — Ratification Clause

- **Status:** RATIFIED
- **Authority:** Founder, WebWaka
- **Date:** 2026-02-22
- **Scope:** Canonical Structural Rebase Only

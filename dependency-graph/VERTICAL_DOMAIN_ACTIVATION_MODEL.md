---

## SECTION I — PRINCIPLE OF VERTICAL DOMAIN ACTIVATION

Vertical Domain Activation is a controlled, Founder-authorized unlocking of a specific business capability domain across all biological layers (Organelle → Cell → Tissue → Organ → System → Organism), while all unrelated domains remain locked in a non-executable state. No partial cross-domain activation is permitted. No activation may occur without dependency completeness. No upward override or lower-layer mutation is permitted.

---

## SECTION II — DOMAIN ACTIVATION TOKEN MODEL

A Domain Activation Token (DAT) is a constitutional authorization artifact issued only by **webwaka007 (Founder)** that unlocks execution eligibility for a defined vertical domain. Each DAT must include:

- Domain Name
- Scope (Organs included)
- Required Lower-Layer Dependencies
- Activation Wave Identifier
- Synchronization Floor Requirement
- Expiration/Revocation Conditions

Only one active DAT is permitted per domain. Multiple domains may be active simultaneously only if their dependencies do not conflict. DAT issuance requires governance validation by **webwakaagent1 (Governance Authority)**.

---

## SECTION III — DOMAIN LOCK STATES

All structures will now have the following execution states:

- **dormant:** Generated but not executable.
- **activated:** Eligible for pickup.
- **suspended:** Temporarily paused due to a dependency issue.
- **revoked:** Activation removed by the Founder.

All structures default to `dormant`. Activation converts a structure to `activated`. Revocation converts a structure to `revoked`. Suspended structures cannot progress through phases.

---

## SECTION IV — VERTICAL DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION MODEL

Before activation, all required lower-layer components must exist as issue trees, and all structural dependencies must be declared. No cross-domain undeclared dependencies are permitted. A structure may not be activated unless all its downward dependencies are at a minimum of Phase 0.

---

## SECTION V — CROSS-LAYER PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION RULE

For an activated domain, phase advancement is allowed only if downward dependencies are at least at Phase `N+1`, there are no frozen entries in the dependency chain, and there are no cross-layer invariant violations. If any lower-layer structure becomes frozen, the entire domain enters the `suspended` state.

---

## SECTION VI — DOMAIN ACTIVATION SEQUENCING OPTIONS

Two activation patterns are available:

1.  **Vertical Single-Domain Activation:** Activate one domain fully, complete all 7 phases across all layers for that domain, and ratify before activating another domain.
2.  **Parallel Multi-Domain Activation:** Activate multiple domains simultaneously, permitted only if there are no shared unstable dependencies, no domain boundary overlap, and governance validation has passed.

The Founder selects the activation pattern.

---

## SECTION VII — TRACKER INTEGRATION

The `MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` will be updated to include the following columns:

- Domain
- Activation Status
- Activation Wave
- DAT Reference
- Domain Synchronization Phase
- Dependency Integrity Score

---

## SECTION VIII — DRIFT PREVENTION & FREEZE ESCALATION

Mandatory freeze triggers include:

- Cross-domain dependency contamination
- Domain boundary collapse
- Activation without a DAT
- Downward invariant mutation
- Phase desynchronization across layers
- Unauthorized activation attempt

A single invariant breach across an activated domain results in automatic domain suspension. The Founder retains authority for global freeze, domain revocation, and amendment approval.

## SECTION IX — COMMERCE & TRANSPORTATION ACTIVATION EXAMPLE

### Commerce Suite Activation

- **Organs:** Commerce Organ
- **Required Tissues:** [List of required Tissues]
- **Required Cells:** [List of required Cells]
- **Required Organelles:** [List of required Organelles]
- **Hosting System:** [Name of hosting System]
- **Organism Configuration:** [Details of Organism configuration]

### Transportation Suite Activation

- **Organs:** Transportation Organ
- **Required Tissues:** [List of required Tissues]
- **Required Cells:** [List of required Cells]
- **Required Organelles:** [List of required Organelles]
- **Hosting System:** [Name of hosting System]
- **Organism Configuration:** [Details of Organism configuration]

This example must demonstrate DAT issuance, dependency validation, synchronization floor enforcement, and tracker update requirements.

---

## SECTION X — GLOBAL STACK COMPLETION LOGIC

Vertical activation does not override the full biological stack completion criteria or the 100% layer ratification requirement for global closure. It enables strategic launch, revenue generation, and iterative expansion, but full program completion requires all domains to be ratified, all layers to be 100% ratified, no frozen entries, and a Founder declaration.

## SECTION XII — PRIMITIVE INTEGRATION DISCIPLINE COMPLIANCE

All activated domains must comply with the primitive integration discipline defined in `ORGANELLE_CATEGORY_DEPENDENCY_GLOBAL_MAP.md`. This includes the mandatory use of CI, EI, and IN categories for their designated purposes. Domain Activation Token issuance requires full integration coverage completeness, and Pre-Generation completeness includes the presence of CI, EI, and IN archetypes.

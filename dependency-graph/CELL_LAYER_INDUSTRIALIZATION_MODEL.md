# CELL LAYER INDUSTRIALIZATION MODEL

---

## SECTION I — PURPOSE

This document is the constitutional authority governing the industrialized execution of the Cell Layer (Layer 2). No Cell industrialization may commence until the Organelle Layer (Layer 1) is 100% ratified. All Cells must comply with the invariants of their constituent Organelles, and no Cell may redefine Organelle semantics.

---

## SECTION II — CELL DEFINITION

A Cell is a compositional unit formed by orchestrating multiple ratified Organelles into a coherent, higher-order capability structure. 

- A Cell **MUST** be composed only of ratified Organelles.
- A Cell **MUST NOT** introduce new primitive categories.
- A Cell **MUST NOT** embed UI logic.
- A Cell **MUST NOT** embed deployment topology.

---

## SECTION III — INDUSTRIALIZATION GATING RULE

Cell bulk generation is permitted only when the following conditions are met:

- The Organelle Layer is 100% ratified.
- The global drift scan is clean.
- There are no frozen entries in the Organelle Layer.
- Founder authorization has been granted.

Partial unlocking of the Cell Layer is not permitted.

---

## SECTION IV — CELL TASK HIERARCHY MODEL

The task hierarchy for a Cell is a strict three-level model:

1.  **Level 1:** Cell Master Issue
2.  **Level 2:** 7 Phase Issues (0–6)
3.  **Level 3:** Atomic Task Units

A minimum of 21 atomic tasks (3 per phase) is required for each Cell. No fourth level is permitted.

---

## SECTION V — CELL NUMBERING MODEL

The standardized identifier format for a Cell is:
`CEL-<DOMAINCODE>-<CELLNAME>-v<Version>`

- **Master Issue Format:** `[CellID] Master Issue`
- **Phase Issue Format:** `[CellID-P#] Phase Name`
- **Atomic Task Format:** `[CellID-P#-T##] Task Name`
- **Version Inheritance Rule:** A Cell's version must inherit from the versions of its constituent Organelles.

---

## SECTION VI — ORGANELE-TO-CELL DEPENDENCY MODEL

- All Organelles composing a Cell must be at least **Phase 4 (Verified)** before the Cell's Phase 3 (Implementation) can begin.
- No Cell may depend on an unverified Organelle.
- Dependency declaration is mandatory in the Cell Master Issue.
- No upward dependencies are permitted.

---

## SECTION VII — PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION FLOOR

A cross-layer phase synchronization floor is enforced to maintain stability:

- **Synchronization Floor:** Cell Phase `N` may only begin when all composing Organelles are at or beyond Phase `N+1`.
- **Dependency Verification:** This dependency must be verified before phase transition.
- **Lock Rule:** A Cell is locked if any of its dependent Organelles are frozen or blocked.

---

## SECTION VIII — PARALLELIZATION RULES

- **Allowed:** Multiple Cells may be in Phase 0 or Phase 1 simultaneously.
- **Not Allowed:** A Cell cannot enter Phase 3 if its Organelle dependencies are not met. Parallel implementation of Cells sharing the same Organelles is not allowed unless explicitly declared and approved.

---

## SECTION IX — DRIFT PREVENTION

The following are specific freeze triggers for the Cell Layer:

- **Cross-Organelle Semantic Mutation:** A Cell altering the intended meaning of a constituent Organelle.
- **Primitive Leakage:** A Cell exposing the primitive functions of its Organelles directly.
- **Business Logic Embedding:** A Cell containing domain-specific business logic.
- **Upward Override Attempt:** A Cell attempting to override the constraints of the Tissue Layer.
- **Downward Mutation Attempt:** A Cell attempting to alter the behavior of a constituent Organelle.

---

## SECTION X — WAVE EXPANSION MODEL

The Cell Layer will also follow a wave-based industrialization model, mirroring the Organelle Layer:

- Wave 1 Cells
- Wave 2 Cells
- Wave 3 Cells

No wave activation is permitted without Founder authorization.

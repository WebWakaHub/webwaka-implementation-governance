_content="""# ORGANISM LAYER INDUSTRIALIZATION MODEL

---

## SECTION I — PURPOSE

This document is the supreme industrialization authority governing the execution of the Organism Layer (Layer 6). No Organism industrialization may commence before the System Layer (Layer 5) is 100% ratified. The Organism must preserve the invariants of all lower layers. No upward override is permitted. The Organism governs evolution, not implementation.

---

## SECTION II — ORGANISM DEFINITION

An Organism is the constitutionally self-regulating, multi-system entity that governs cross-system coherence, evolution, and invariant enforcement.

- An Organism **MUST** be composed only of ratified Systems.
- An Organism **MUST** enforce lower-layer invariants.
- An Organism **MUST** define evolution mechanics.
- An Organism **MUST NOT** implement infrastructure logic.
- An Organism **MUST NOT** bypass System boundaries.

---

## SECTION III — INDUSTRIALIZATION GATING RULE

Organism bulk generation is permitted only when the following conditions are met:

- The System Layer is 100% ratified.
- There are no frozen entries in the System Layer.
- The global drift scan is clean.
- Founder authorization has been granted.

Partial unlocking of the Organism Layer is not permitted.

---

## SECTION IV — ORGANISM TASK HIERARCHY MODEL

The task hierarchy for an Organism is a strict three-level model:

1.  **Level 1:** Organism Master Issue
2.  **Level 2:** 7 Phase Issues (0–6)
3.  **Level 3:** Atomic Task Units

A minimum of 21 atomic tasks (3 per phase) is required for each Organism. No fourth level is permitted.

---

## SECTION V — ORGANISM NUMBERING MODEL

The standardized identifier format for an Organism is:
`ORGSM-<ENTITYCODE>-<ORGANISMNAME>-v<Version>`

- **Master Issue Format:** `[OrganismID] Master Issue`
- **Phase Issue Format:** `[OrganismID-P#] Phase Name`
- **Atomic Task Format:** `[OrganismID-P#-T##] Task Name`
- **Version Inheritance Rule:** An Organism's version must inherit from the versions of its constituent Systems.

---

## SECTION VI — SYSTEM-TO-ORGANISM DEPENDENCY MODEL

- All Systems composing an Organism must be at least **Phase 4 (Verified)** before the Organism's Phase 3 (Implementation) can begin.
- No Organism may depend on an unverified System.
- Dependency declaration is mandatory in the Organism Master Issue.
- No upward dependencies are permitted.

---

## SECTION VII — PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION FLOOR

A cross-layer phase synchronization floor is enforced to maintain stability:

- **Synchronization Floor:** Organism Phase `N` may only begin when all composing Systems are at or beyond Phase `N+1`.
- **Dependency Verification:** This dependency must be verified before phase transition.
- **Lock Rule:** An Organism is locked if any of its dependent Systems are frozen or blocked.

---

## SECTION VIII — CROSS-SYSTEM GOVERNANCE INTEGRATION

- The Organism enforces cross-system policy discipline.
- No system-level override is permitted without a constitutional amendment.
- Cross-system conflict resolution is governed by the Organism.
- Invariant propagation is enforced by the Organism.
- Cross-system duplication is detected and resolved by the Organism.

---

## SECTION IX — EVOLUTION CONTROL MODEL

- Version evolution discipline is enforced.
- Amendment discipline is enforced.
- Backward compatibility is enforced.
- Deprecation is governed by the Organism.
- Controlled expansion is governed by the Organism.

---

## SECTION X — GLOBAL STABILITY ENFORCEMENT

The following are specific freeze triggers for the Organism Layer:

- **Cross-System Invariant Breach:** A violation of an invariant that crosses System boundaries.
- **System Boundary Collapse:** A violation of the domain boundaries of a constituent System.
- **Unauthorized Amendment:** An attempt to amend the constitution without authorization.
- **Downward Mutation Attempt:** An Organism attempting to alter the behavior of a constituent System.
- **Structural Explosion:** An unplanned proliferation of substructures.
- **Version Desynchronization:** Incompatible versions between a structure and its substructures.

---

## SECTION XI — PARALLELIZATION RULES

- **Allowed:** Organism Phase 0 and Phase 1 parallel work units are permitted.
- **Not Allowed:** An Organism cannot enter Phase 3 if its System dependencies are not met. Structural changes are not allowed while Systems are unstable.

---

## SECTION XII — WAVE EXPANSION MODEL

The Organism Layer may follow a wave-based industrialization model:

- Wave 1 Governance Expansion
- Wave 2 Evolution Expansion
- Wave 3 Ecosystem Expansion

No wave activation is permitted without Founder authorization.

---

## SECTION XIII — GLOBAL TRACKER INTEGRATION

Additional tracking requirements for the Organism Layer include:

- Parent Systems declared
- Global invariant score
- Evolution phase recorded
- Structural risk score
- Amendment history linkage

---

## SECTION XIV — FEDERATION GOVERNANCE INTERFACE

The Organism Layer governs cross-instance evolution through integration with the **Federation Plane** as defined in **PLATFORM_FEDERATION_CONSTITUTION.md**.

### Version Authority Clause

The Organism Layer retains **exclusive constitutional authority** to define version semantics for the entire WebWaka platform, as established in **VERSION_EVOLUTION_AND_PATCH_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md**.

### Version Definition Authority

The Organism Layer defines:

- **Global platform version** — Semantic version for the entire biological stack (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Version roadmap** — Evolution strategy and release schedule
- **Compatibility matrix** — Cross-layer version dependencies and compatibility windows
- **Migration paths** — Upgrade sequences for major version transitions
- **Deprecation lifecycle** — Feature sunset schedule and migration assistance
- **Patch classification** — Security, stability, feature, compatibility, and infrastructure patches

**Invariant:** The Organism Layer retains exclusive authority to define version semantics. Federation Plane executes propagation only.

### Version Inheritance Discipline

All lower layers inherit version discipline from the Organism Layer:

- **System Layer** — Inherits major and minor version from Organism
- **Organ Layer** — Inherits version compatibility requirements
- **Tissue Layer** — Inherits semantic versioning discipline
- **Cell Layer** — Inherits backward compatibility rules
- **Organelle Layer** — Inherits patch classification model
- **Runtime Plane** — Inherits compatibility matrix enforcement

### Version Evolution Governance

The Organism Layer governs version evolution through:

- **Semantic versioning enforcement** — MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH discipline
- **Breaking change governance** — Major version increments for breaking changes
- **Backward compatibility windows** — 90-day migration windows for major versions
- **Security patch authority** — Mandatory 24-hour deployment for critical patches
- **Deprecation notice periods** — 30/90/180 days based on feature criticality

### Cross-Instance Propagation

The Federation Plane executes:

- **Update distribution** — Propagates updates to all registered instances
- **Compliance enforcement** — Monitors version drift and enforces update windows
- **Entitlement validation** — Verifies subscription tier eligibility
- **Rollback coordination** — Executes rollback across instances if required

**Invariant:** The Federation Plane executes propagation only. It does NOT define version authority.

### Instance-Level Update Binding

The Runtime Plane enforces:

- **Update ingestion** — Validates and binds updates to runtime
- **Deployment execution** — Deploys updates to instance infrastructure
- **Rollback mechanism** — Reverts to previous version if deployment fails
- **Compliance reporting** — Reports version status to Federation Plane

**Invariant:** The Runtime Plane retains execution authority. Federation Plane provides governance only.

### Authority Hierarchy

```
Organism Layer (Defines)
    ↓
Federation Plane (Executes)
    ↓
Runtime Plane (Binds)
    ↓
Instance (Deploys)
```

### Capability Invariant Preservation

All updates propagated through the Federation Plane MUST:

- Preserve capability semantics across all biological layers
- NOT require refactoring of Organelle, Cell, Tissue, Organ, or System layers
- Maintain API compatibility within backward compatibility windows
- Support rollback without data loss

---

## SECTION XV — PROGRAM COMPLETION LOCK

Full biological stack completion occurs only when:

- All 6 layers are 100% ratified.
- There are no frozen entries.
- There are no blocked entries.
- The global drift scan is clean.
- The Founder declares closure.

Until then, industrialization remains active.

_content='''# TISSUE_LAYER_GLOBAL_DOMAIN_BLUEPRINT.md

This document defines canonical Tissue coordination structures required by all 58 Organs across 18 domains.

No Domain Structure Map may define Tissue structures outside this blueprint.

## SECTION I — TISSUE MODELING PRINCIPLES

- Tissue coordinates Cells
- Tissue must NOT contain business semantics
- Tissue must NOT redefine Organ boundaries
- Tissue must NOT bypass Cell abstraction
- Tissue may be reused across multiple Organs within same domain
- Cross-domain Tissue reuse must be declared

## SECTION II — CANONICAL TISSUE PATTERNS

| Tissue Name | Tissue Code | Coordination Role | Composed Cell Types (placeholders) | Allowed Domains | Prohibited Domains | Invariant Preservation Statement |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Command Coordination Tissue | TIS-CMDCOORD-v0.1.0 | Coordinates command execution across multiple cells | CEL-COMMAND, CEL-VALIDATION, CEL-RESPONSE | All | None | This tissue must not alter the semantics of the commands it coordinates. |
| State Aggregation Tissue | TIS-STATEAGG-v0.1.0 | Aggregates state from multiple cells into a consistent view | CEL-STATE, CEL-QUERY | All | None | This tissue must not modify the state of the cells it aggregates. |
| Workflow Orchestration Tissue | TIS-WORKFLOW-v0.1.0 | Orchestrates a sequence of operations across multiple cells | CEL-STEP, CEL-TRANSITION, CEL-COMPENSATION, CEL-CIGATEWAY | All | None | This tissue must not embed business logic within its orchestration steps. |
| Policy Enforcement Tissue | TIS-POLICY-v0.1.0 | Enforces policies by coordinating validation and action cells | CEL-POLICY, CEL-VALIDATION, CEL-ACTION | All | None | This tissue must not define policies, only enforce them. |
| Event Propagation Tissue | TIS-EVENT-v0.1.0 | Propagates events between cells and to other tissues | CEL-EVENTSOURCE, CEL-EVENTLISTENER, CEL-CIGATEWAY | All | None | This tissue must not modify the content of the events it propagates. |
| Validation Coordination Tissue | TIS-VALIDATE-v0.1.0 | Coordinates validation rules across multiple cells | CEL-VALIDATION, CEL-RULE | All | None | This tissue must not define validation rules, only coordinate their execution. |
| Resource Allocation Tissue | TIS-RESOURCE-v0.1.0 | Allocates and deallocates resources across multiple cells | CEL-RESOURCE, CEL-ALLOCATION | All | None | This tissue must not manage the lifecycle of the resources it allocates. |
| Monitoring & Feedback Tissue | TIS-MONITOR-v0.1.0 | Monitors cell activity and provides feedback | CEL-METRIC, CEL-ALERT, CEL-FEEDBACK, CEL-TELEMETRY | All | None | This tissue must not alter the behavior of the cells it monitors. |

## SECTION IV — CROSS-DOMAIN TISSUE COLLISION AUDIT

| Tissue Pattern | Used By Domains | Risk of Semantic Drift | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| TIS-CMDCOORD | All | Low | The pattern is generic and does not contain business logic. |
| TIS-STATEAGG | All | Low | The pattern is generic and does not contain business logic. |
| TIS-WORKFLOW | All | Medium | Workflows must be defined in the Organ layer to avoid semantic drift. The use of CEL-CIGATEWAY must be strictly for cross-domain communication, not business logic. |
| TIS-POLICY | All | Low | The pattern is generic and does not contain business logic. |
| TIS-EVENT | All | Low | The pattern is generic and does not contain business logic. |
| TIS-VALIDATE | All | Low | The pattern is generic and does not contain business logic. |
| TIS-RESOURCE | All | Low | The pattern is generic and does not contain business logic. |
| TIS-MONITOR | All | Low | The pattern is generic and does not contain business logic. |

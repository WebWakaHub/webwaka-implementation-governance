_content="""# SYSTEM LAYER INDUSTRIALIZATION MODEL

---

## SECTION I — PURPOSE

This document is the constitutional authority governing the industrialized execution of the System Layer (Layer 5). No System industrialization may commence before the Organ Layer (Layer 4) is 100% ratified. All Systems must comply with the invariants of their constituent Organs, Tissues, Cells, and Organelles, and no System may redefine the semantics of these lower layers.

---

## SECTION II — SYSTEM DEFINITION

A System is a coherent, platform-level assembly of ratified Organs that forms a unified capability surface.

- A System **MUST** be composed only of ratified Organs.
- A System **MUST** maintain domain coherence.
- A System **MAY** host UI, but it **MUST NOT** define UI primitives.
- A System **MUST NOT** define infrastructure topology.
- A System **MUST NOT** collapse Organ boundaries.
- A System **MUST NOT** act as an Ecosystem.

---

## SECTION III — INDUSTRIALIZATION GATING RULE

System bulk generation is permitted only when the following conditions are met:

- The Organ Layer is 100% ratified.
- There are no frozen entries in the Organ Layer.
- The global drift scan is clean.
- Founder authorization has been granted.

Partial unlocking of the System Layer is not permitted.

---

## SECTION IV — SYSTEM TASK HIERARCHY MODEL

The task hierarchy for a System is a strict three-level model:

1.  **Level 1:** System Master Issue
2.  **Level 2:** 7 Phase Issues (0–6)
3.  **Level 3:** Atomic Task Units

A minimum of 21 atomic tasks (3 per phase) is required for each System. No fourth level is permitted.

---

## SECTION V — SYSTEM NUMBERING MODEL

The standardized identifier format for a System is:
`SYS-<PLATFORMCODE>-<SYSTEMNAME>-v<Version>`

- **Master Issue Format:** `[SystemID] Master Issue`
- **Phase Issue Format:** `[SystemID-P#] Phase Name`
- **Atomic Task Format:** `[SystemID-P#-T##] Task Name`
- **Version Inheritance Rule:** A System's version must inherit from the versions of its constituent Organs.

---

## SECTION VI — ORGAN-TO-SYSTEM DEPENDENCY MODEL

- All Organs composing a System must be at least **Phase 4 (Verified)** before the System's Phase 3 (Implementation) can begin.
- No System may depend on an unverified Organ.
- Dependency declaration is mandatory in the System Master Issue.
- No upward dependencies are permitted.

---

## SECTION VII — PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION FLOOR

A cross-layer phase synchronization floor is enforced to maintain stability:

- **Synchronization Floor:** System Phase `N` may only begin when all composing Organs are at or beyond Phase `N+1`.
- **Dependency Verification:** This dependency must be verified before phase transition.
- **Lock Rule:** A System is locked if any of its dependent Organs are frozen or blocked.

---

## SECTION VIII — PLATFORM COHERENCE ENFORCEMENT

- A System must represent a coherent platform or suite.
- No unrelated domain merging is permitted without a formal constitutional amendment.
- Organ boundary preservation rules must be enforced.
- Capability duplication detection rules must be applied during the design phase.
- A platform coherence validation mechanism must be implemented.

---

## SECTION IX — INTER-SYSTEM INTEROPERABILITY RULES

- Systems may interoperate but **MUST NOT** fuse.
- No structural merging of Systems is permitted without a formal constitutional amendment.
- Interface contract discipline is mandatory.
- Dependency direction discipline must be enforced (no circular inter-system dependencies).

---

## SECTION X — PARALLELIZATION RULES

- **Allowed:** Multiple Systems may be in Phase 0 or Phase 1 simultaneously.
- **Not Allowed:** A System cannot enter Phase 3 if its Organ dependencies are not met. Parallel implementation of Systems sharing unstable Organs is forbidden. Cross-platform merging during implementation is forbidden.

---

## SECTION XI — DRIFT PREVENTION

The following are specific freeze triggers for the System Layer:

- **Platform Incoherence:** A System exhibiting behavior inconsistent with its declared platform.
- **Organ Boundary Collapse:** A System violating the domain boundaries of its constituent Organs.
- **Cross-System Fusion:** An attempt to merge two Systems without a constitutional amendment.
- **Deployment Logic Embedding:** A System containing deployment-specific logic.
- **Downward Mutation Attempt:** A System attempting to alter the behavior of a constituent Organ.
- **Upward Override Attempt:** A System attempting to override the constraints of the Organism Layer.

---

## SECTION XII — WAVE EXPANSION MODEL

The System Layer will also follow a wave-based industrialization model:

- Wave 1 Systems
- Wave 2 Systems
- Wave 3 Systems

No wave activation is permitted without Founder authorization.

---

## SECTION XIII — GLOBAL TRACKER INTEGRATION

Additional tracking requirements for the System Layer include:

- Parent Organs declared
- Platform coherence declaration
- Downstream Organism dependencies declared
- Synchronization phase recorded
- Structural risk score calculated

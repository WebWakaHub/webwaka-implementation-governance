# PLATFORM_FEDERATION_CONSTITUTION.md

**Subtitle:** Distributed Instance Governance & Federation Control Framework

**Status:** RATIFIED  
**Authority:** Founder  
**Date:** 2026-02-19  
**Binding:** Constitutional

---

## SECTION I — CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY

The **Federation Plane** is hereby established as a constitutional layer governing the distributed operation, evolution synchronization, and cross-instance governance of all WebWaka runtime instances.

### Constitutional Scope

The Federation Plane governs:

- **Distributed runtime instances** across deployment topologies
- **Update propagation** and patch distribution
- **Patch governance** and security enforcement
- **Subscription entitlement** and feature gating
- **Cross-instance evolution synchronization**

### Architectural Position

The Federation Plane:

- **Sits above** the Runtime Plane
- **Operates under** Organism layer evolution authority
- **Executes** cross-instance governance without modifying capability semantics
- **Preserves** the infrastructure-neutral discipline of all biological layers

### Authority Delegation

- **Organism Layer** defines version authority and evolution roadmap
- **Federation Plane** executes propagation and compliance enforcement
- **Runtime Plane** executes instance-level update binding and deployment
- **Capability Layers** (Organelle → System) remain unaffected by federation operations

---

## SECTION II — INSTANCE DEFINITION

A **WebWaka Instance** is a deployed, operational instantiation of the WebWaka platform executing within a specific runtime environment.

### Instance Types

**1. SaaS Shared Instance**

- Multi-tenant deployment
- Shared infrastructure
- Tenant isolation via runtime
- Centralized update management

**2. Dedicated Enterprise Instance**

- Single-tenant deployment

**3. White-Label Provider Instance**

- Provider-branded deployment
- Provider-managed infrastructure
- Federated update eligibility
- Subscription tier enforcement

### Mandatory Instance Metadata

Every instance MUST maintain and expose:

| Metadata Field | Description | Format |
|---|---|---|
| **Instance ID** | Globally unique instance identifier | UUID v4 |

## SECTION IV — FEDERATION HANDSHAKE PROTOCOL

The **Federation Handshake** establishes secure, authenticated communication between a WebWaka instance and the Federation Plane.

### Handshake Sequence

**1. Instance Registration**

- Instance generates cryptographic keypair
- Instance submits registration request with public key
- Federation validates instance identity and subscription
- Federation issues signed Instance ID

**2. Version Reporting**

- Instance reports current version metadata for all layers
- Federation validates version compatibility
- Federation records instance version state
- Federation determines update eligibility

**3. Subscription Validation**

- Instance submits subscription credentials
- Federation validates entitlement tier
- Federation determines active domain eligibility
- Federation issues entitlement token

**4. Entitlement Verification**

- Instance requests feature module activation
- Federation validates subscription tier eligibility
- Federation issues signed activation token
- Runtime binds module based on token

**5. Secure Channel Requirements**

All federation communication MUST:

- Use TLS 1.3 or higher
- Employ mutual TLS authentication
- Validate certificate chains
- Implement request signing
- Enforce rate limiting

**6. Signed Update Enforcement**

All updates MUST:

- Be cryptographically signed by federation authority
- Include version metadata and compatibility matrix
- Include rollback instructions
- Be verified by runtime before binding

### No Vendor-Specific Details

The handshake protocol MUST remain infrastructure-neutral. No hardcoded:

- Cloud provider APIs
- Database connection strings
- Message broker endpoints
- Logging service URLs
- Monitoring platform integrations

---

## SECTION V — UPDATE PROPAGATION AUTHORITY

The Federation Plane executes update propagation across all registered instances according to version authority defined by the Organism layer.

### Update Categories

**1. Security Patch Propagation**

- **Trigger:** Critical security vulnerability identified
- **Authority:** Organism layer defines patch
- **Propagation:** Federation executes immediate distribution
- **Enforcement:** Forced update within 24 hours
- **Rollback:** Automatic if deployment fails

**2. Minor Version Upgrade**

- **Trigger:** Bug fixes, performance improvements, non-breaking changes
- **Authority:** Organism layer defines version
- **Propagation:** Federation notifies instances
- **Enforcement:** Optional within 30-day window
- **Rollback:** Supported for 7 days post-upgrade

**3. Major Version Migration**

- **Trigger:** Breaking changes, architectural refactoring
- **Authority:** Organism layer defines migration path
- **Propagation:** Federation provides migration guide
- **Enforcement:** Required within 90-day window
- **Rollback:** Supported for 30 days post-migration

**4. Feature Module Injection**

- **Trigger:** New domain activation or subscription upgrade
- **Authority:** Federation validates entitlement
- **Propagation:** Federation issues signed activation token
- **Enforcement:** Runtime binds module
- **Rollback:** Module deactivation supported

### Authority Hierarchy

```
Organism Layer (Defines)
    ↓
Federation Plane (Executes)
    ↓
Runtime Plane (Binds)
    ↓
Instance (Deploys)
```

**Invariant:** Federation Plane MUST NOT define version authority. It executes propagation only.

## SECTION VI — VERSION COMPATIBILITY DISCIPLINE

The Federation Plane enforces version compatibility across all layers to prevent semantic drift and ensure cross-instance consistency.

### Cross-Layer Version Synchronization

All layers MUST maintain synchronized versions:

| Layer | Version Format | Compatibility Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Organelle | `ORG-XX-NAME-vX.Y.Z` | Must match Cell layer dependency |
| Cell | `CELL-XX-NAME-vX.Y.Z` | Must match Tissue layer dependency |
| Tissue | `TIS-NAME-vX.Y.Z` | Must match Organ layer dependency |
| Organ | `ORGX-XX-NAME-vX.Y.Z` | Must match System layer dependency |
| System | `SYS-NAME-vX.Y.Z` | Must match Organism layer version |
| Organism | `ORGANISM-vX.Y.Z` | Defines global platform version |
| Runtime | `RUNTIME-vX.Y.Z` | Must be compatible with Organism version |

### Runtime Compatibility Matrix

| Organism Version | Minimum Runtime Version | Maximum Runtime Version |
|---|---|---|
| v0.1.x | v0.1.0 | v0.2.0 |
| v0.2.x | v0.2.0 | v0.3.0 |
| v1.0.x | v1.0.0 | v2.0.0 |

### Domain Activation Minimum Version

Each domain module declares a minimum platform version:

```
Domain: COM (Commerce)
Minimum Platform Version: v0.2.0
Reason: Requires TIS-WORKFLOW-v0.2.0
```

### Backward Compatibility Windows

- **Minor versions:** Backward compatible within same major version
- **Major versions:** 90-day compatibility window for migration
- **Security patches:** Must preserve API compatibility

### Forced Upgrade Rules (Security)

If a critical security vulnerability is identified:

1. Federation issues forced upgrade notice
2. Instances have 24 hours to deploy patch
3. Non-compliant instances transition to **Out-of-Compliance** state
4. After 48 hours, non-compliant instances transition to **Suspended** state

---

## SECTION VII — FEATURE ENTITLEMENT INTEGRATION

The Federation Plane enforces subscription tier entitlements and governs feature module activation.

### Subscription Tier Gating

| Tier | Domain Limit | Custom Domains | Runtime Mode | Support Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | 3 domains | No | SaaS Shared | Community |
| **Pro** | 10 domains | No | SaaS Shared | Email |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | Yes | Dedicated | Priority |
| **Custom** | Unlimited | Yes | White-Label | Dedicated |

### Domain Expansion Rules

- **Free → Pro:** Immediate activation of up to 10 domains
- **Pro → Enterprise:** Immediate activation of unlimited domains + dedicated runtime
- **Enterprise → Custom:** White-label branding + custom domain support

### Module Activation Discipline

**Activation Sequence:**

1. User requests domain activation
2. Federation validates subscription tier eligibility
3. Federation checks minimum platform version
4. Federation issues signed activation token
5. Runtime binds domain module
6. Instance reports activation success

**Deactivation Sequence:**

1. Subscription downgrade or lapse detected
2. Federation issues deactivation notice
3. Runtime unbinds domain module
4. Instance transitions to compliant state

### Safe Injection Protocol

All module injections MUST:

- Preserve existing capability semantics
- Not require refactoring of active domains
- Support rollback within 7 days
- Maintain backward compatibility

---

## SECTION VIII — GLOBAL INVARIANTS

The following invariants are constitutionally binding on all Federation Plane operations:

### Invariant 1: No Capability Refactor Required for Updates

Updates MUST NOT require refactoring of capability logic in Organelle, Cell, Tissue, Organ, or System layers.

**Rationale:** Capability layers are infrastructure-neutral and must remain stable across updates.

### Invariant 2: Runtime Plane Must Support Reversible Updates

All updates MUST be reversible via rollback mechanism.

**Rationale:** Ensures operational safety and minimizes deployment risk.

### Invariant 3: Instances Must Not Fork Capability Semantics

All instances MUST execute identical capability semantics for a given version.

**Rationale:** Prevents semantic drift and ensures cross-instance consistency.

### Invariant 4: Federation Must Not Bypass Runtime Governance

Federation Plane MUST NOT directly modify runtime state or bypass runtime governance.

**Rationale:** Maintains separation of concerns and preserves runtime authority.

### Invariant 5: Organism Layer Retains Evolution Authority

Organism layer defines version roadmap and evolution strategy. Federation executes propagation only.

**Rationale:** Preserves architectural authority and prevents governance bypass.

---

## SECTION IX — ENFORCEMENT MODEL

The Federation Plane enforces compliance through automated audits, state transitions, and escalation protocols.

### Compliance Audits

**Frequency:** Daily for all Active instances

**Audit Checks:**

- Version metadata accuracy
- Subscription tier validation
- Security patch status
- Domain activation compliance
- Runtime compatibility

### Out-of-Compliance Detection

An instance is **Out-of-Compliance** if:

- Version drift exceeds 30 days
- Security patch overdue by 48 hours
- Subscription tier mismatch detected
- Domain activation violates entitlement
- Runtime version incompatible with Organism version

### Forced Suspension

An instance is **Suspended** if:

- Out-of-Compliance for 60 days
- Security violation detected
- Subscription lapsed for 14 days
- Manual suspension by founder authority

### Version Drift Freeze

If version drift exceeds 90 days:

- Instance transitions to **Revoked** state
- Federation access terminated
- Requires founder authority to restore

### Escalation Authority (Founder)

Founder authority may:

- Override compliance rules
- Force immediate suspension
- Revoke instance access
- Restore revoked instances
- Modify federation governance

---

## SECTION X — VERSION GOVERNANCE INTEGRATION CLAUSE

The Federation Plane executes update propagation under the authority of **VERSION_EVOLUTION_AND_PATCH_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md**.

### Version Governance Authority

All Federation Plane operations MUST comply with:

- **Patch classification** as defined in VERSION_EVOLUTION_AND_PATCH_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md
- **Compatibility matrix** enforcement for all instances
- **Upgrade sequencing rules** for major version transitions
- **Deprecation lifecycle** for feature sunset
- **Rollback discipline** for failed updates

### Compliance State Integration

Instance lifecycle states MUST reference the compatibility matrix:

- **Out-of-Compliance** state triggered by version drift beyond compatibility window
- **Suspended** state triggered by security patch refusal beyond 72 hours
- **Revoked** state triggered by unauthorized version fork

### Forced Security Patch Authority

The Federation Plane MUST enforce mandatory security patches:

- **24-hour deployment window** for critical security patches
- **Automatic suspension** for non-compliant instances after 48 hours
- **No opt-out mechanism** for security patches

### Staged Rollout Enforcement

The Federation Plane MUST execute staged rollouts:

- **Canary Phase:** 5% of instances (24 hours)
- **Beta Phase:** 25% of instances (48 hours)
- **General Availability:** 100% of instances

**Rollback Trigger:** If failure rate exceeds thresholds, rollback all instances.

### Version Synchronization Authority

The Federation Plane MUST prevent ecosystem fragmentation:

- Enforce version synchronization across all instances
- Prevent unauthorized version forks
- Monitor version drift and trigger compliance audits
- Escalate repeated violations to Founder authority

**Invariant:** Federation Plane executes propagation under version governance. It does NOT define version authority.

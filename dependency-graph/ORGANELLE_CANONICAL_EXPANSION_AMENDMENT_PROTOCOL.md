# ORGANELLE_CANONICAL_EXPANSION_AMENDMENT_PROTOCOL.md

**Protocol ID:** GAD-01 (Governance Alignment Directive)
**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** RATIFIED

---

## SECTION I — Constitutional Authority

This document executes a constitutional amendment under the authority of the Founder (`webwaka007`). Its scope is strictly limited to the expansion of the Organelle Layer canonical registry to align governance with the verified repository state.

This amendment is consistent with and subordinate to the principles established in the following foundational governance documents:

- `STRICT_INFRASTRUCTURE_NEUTRAL_IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `RUNTIME_PLANE_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `GSFVA-01B_FINAL_CERTIFICATION_REPORT.md`

This protocol formally acknowledges the existence of AI-native organelles as a constitutional reality and integrates them into the canonical framework.

---

## SECTION II — Drift Identification Summary

A recent audit (FARA-02) identified a discrepancy between the ratified governance and the repository reality. This discrepancy is formally classified as follows:

- **Canonical State:** 18 `ORG-` prefixed organelles are constitutionally ratified and certified [1].
- **Repository Reality:** 4 additional, fully industrialized `ORGN-` prefixed organelles exist in the `webwaka-organelle-universe` repository.
- **Structural Integrity:** All 22 structures (18 `ORG-` and 4 `ORGN-`) adhere to the 29-issue structural invariant and are free of corruption.
- **Conclusion:** The governance registry is incomplete and lags behind the implemented reality.

**Official Classification: Canonical Registry Drift — Category: Governance Lag**

## SECTION III — AI-Native Organelle Ratification

By the authority of the Founder, the following four (4) AI-native organelle structures are hereby ratified and integrated into the WebWaka constitutional framework.

| Structure ID | Category Code | Canonical Prefix | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ORGN-AI-AUDIT_EMITTER-v0.1.0` | AI | `ORGN-` | **RATIFIED** |
| `ORGN-AI-COGNITIVE_PORT-v0.1.0` | AI | `ORGN-` | **RATIFIED** |
| `ORGN-AI-PROMPT_ASSEMBLER-v0.1.0` | AI | `ORGN-` | **RATIFIED** |
| `ORGN-AI-RESULT_VALIDATOR-v0.1.0` | AI | `ORGN-` | **RATIFIED** |

**Constitutional Declarations:**

1.  These 4 structures are now **constitutionally recognized canonical organelles**.
2.  They establish a new canonical category: **AI (AI-Native & Cognitive Fabric)**.
3.  To preserve repository stability and avoid breaking changes, their canonical prefix shall remain **`ORGN-`**. This prefix is now constitutionally recognized as a valid, specialized alternative to `ORG-` for the AI category.

---

## SECTION IV — Canonical Count Amendment

The official count of canonical organelles is amended as follows:

- **Previous Canonical Organelle Count:** 18
- **Amended Canonical Organelle Count:** **22**

The global structural invariant for the Organelle Layer is updated:

> **Total Organelle Issues = 22 (Canonical Structures) × 29 (Issues/Structure) = 638**

---

## SECTION V — Registry Update Mandate

This amendment mandates the immediate update of the following governance documents to reflect the new 22-organelle baseline. The `AI` category and `ORGN-` prefix must be formally added.

1.  `dependency-graph/ORGANELLE_CATEGORY_DEPENDENCY_GLOBAL_MAP.md`
2.  `doctrine/ORGANELLE_IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARD.md`
3.  `dependency-graph/MASTER_DOMAIN_STRUCTURE_INDEX.md`
4.  `dependency-graph/GSFVA-01B_FINAL_CERTIFICATION_REPORT.md`
5.  `WEBWAKA_MASTER_DOCUMENT.md` (or its canonical equivalent)

---

## SECTION VI — Certification Baseline Amendment

The GSFVA-01B certification baseline is amended to include the 4 new AI-native organelles. This action extends the certification to cover all 22 organelles and does not invalidate the prior certification of the original 18.

- **Previous Certified Organelle Count:** 18
- **Amended Certified Organelle Count:** **22**

---

## SECTION VII — Activation Discipline Statement

This amendment is a governance alignment action only. It does **NOT** authorize:

- The activation of any organelle, cell, tissue, organ, or system.
- The implementation or modification of any issue.
- Any change in the `state:dormant` status of any structure.

Global activation discipline remains in full effect.

---

## SECTION VIII — Mathematical Integrity Confirmation

The mathematical integrity of the expanded Organelle Layer is confirmed:

- **Original Canonical Issues:** 18 structures × 29 issues/structure = 522
- **AI-Native Issues:** 4 structures × 29 issues/structure = 116
- **New Total Canonical Issues:** 522 + 116 = **638**

- **Repository Reality:** 638 issues (522 `ORG-` + 116 `ORGN-`)
- **Variance:** **0**

There is no mathematical variance, overflow, or orphan structures within the newly defined 22-organelle canonical set.

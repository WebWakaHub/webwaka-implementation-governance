_content="""# FULL STACK DOMAIN PRE-GENERATION PROTOCOL

---

## SECTION I — SCOPE

This protocol applies to the pre-generation of dormant issue trees for selected domains (e.g., Commerce, Transportation) across all 6 biological layers:

- Organelle Layer
- Cell Layer
- Tissue Layer
- Organ Layer
- System Layer
- Organism Layer

---

## SECTION II — PRE-GENERATION REQUIREMENT

For each selected domain, the following must exist in a `dormant` state before a Domain Activation Token (DAT) can be issued:

- 1 Master Issue per structure
- 7 Phase Issues per structure
- Minimum 21 Atomic Tasks per structure

This requirement applies to all structures across all 6 layers of the domain's vertical stack. No structure may default to an `approved` or `in-progress` state.

---

## SECTION III — DOMAIN STRUCTURE MAP REQUIREMENT

Before pre-generation can commence, a Domain Structure Map must be defined for each domain. This map must declare all downward dependencies and confirm the absence of cross-domain or circular dependencies.

**Commerce Domain Structure Map:**
- Required Organs
- Required Tissues
- Required Cells
- Required Organelles
- Hosting System
- Organism context

**Transportation Domain Structure Map:**
- Required Organs
- Required Tissues
- Required Cells
- Required Organelles
- Hosting System
- Organism context

---

## SECTION IV — GENERATION ORDER

Issue trees must be generated in a strict bottom-up order:

1.  Organelle (if missing)
2.  Cell
3.  Tissue
4.  Organ
5.  System
6.  Organism

Skipping layers is not permitted.

---

## SECTION V — TRACKER REGISTRATION

The `MASTER_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` must be updated to record the following for each pre-generated structure:

- Domain
- Layer
- Structure Name
- Activation Status = `dormant`
- Synchronization Phase = 0
- Dependency Integrity Score

---

## SECTION VI — ACTIVATION ELIGIBILITY CHECK

A domain is eligible for DAT issuance only if the following conditions are met:

- 100% of its vertical stack structures exist.
- All are in the `dormant` state.
- There are no dependency gaps.
- There is no cross-domain contamination.
- Governance validation has been passed.
- Founder authorization has been granted.

---

## SECTION VII — HARD STOP

No execution, state transition, or phase advancement is permitted during pre-generation. This is a purely structural preparation process.

---

## SECTION VIII — RATIFICATION STATEMENT

This document is constitutionally binding.

## SECTION IX — PRIMITIVE INTEGRATION DISCIPLINE COMPLIANCE

All pre-generated domains must comply with the primitive integration discipline defined in `ORGANELLE_CATEGORY_DEPENDENCY_GLOBAL_MAP.md`. This includes the mandatory use of CI, EI, and IN categories for their designated purposes. Domain Activation Token issuance requires full integration coverage completeness, and Pre-Generation completeness includes the presence of CI, EI, and IN archetypes.

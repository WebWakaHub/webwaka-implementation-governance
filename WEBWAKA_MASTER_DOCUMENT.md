## SECTION I — CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY & PURPOSE

This document is the **single, consolidated, and canonical source of truth** for the entire WebWaka governance framework. It is generated and maintained under the authority of the Founder (`webwaka007`) and serves as the master reference for all constitutional, structural, and operational protocols.

Any governance modification **MUST** update this Master Document in the same commit to maintain constitutional integrity. Any document or clause not referenced herein is considered non-canonical.

## SECTION II — GLOBAL CERTIFICATION STATUS

The WebWaka stack is **FULLY CERTIFIED** as of 2026-02-21.

| Certification Protocol | Date | Global Integrity Rating |
|---|---|:---:|
| **GSFVA-01B** | 2026-02-21 | **PASS** |

This certification confirms that the full stack of 128 canonical structures and 3,712 issues is structurally sound, mathematically verified, and governance-aligned. Controlled activation is authorized.

**Supporting Audits:**
- `CSRP-01`: Foundational Structural Reality Report
- `LSVR-01` to `LSVR-06`: Per-Layer Structural Verification & Repair
- `GSFVA-01`: Global Stack Final Verification Audit
- `GDFVA-01`: Governance Deep Synchronization Audit

## SECTION III — CANONICAL LAYER CODE REGISTRY

*This registry is the single source of truth for all layer identification codes. Automation MUST rely on GitHub labels (`layer:*`) for layer identification, not structural prefix parsing alone.*

| Governance Layer Code | Layer | Structural Prefix | GitHub Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ORGL` | Organelle | `ORG-` | `layer:organelle` |
| `CEL` | Cell | `CEL-` | `layer:cell` |
| `TIS` | Tissue | `TIS-` | `layer:tissue` |
| `ORGX` | Organ | `ORGX-` | `layer:organ` |
| `SYS` | System | `SYS-` | `layer:system` |
| `ORGM` | Organism | `ORG-` | `layer:organism` |
| `RUN` | Runtime | `RUNTIME-` | `layer:runtime` |

---

---

## SECTION V — GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK SUMMARIES

### 5.1 Runtime Plane Constitution
- **Governs:** Infrastructure binding, deployment topology, execution orchestration.
- **Key Principle:** Maintains strict separation from biological capability layers.
- **Reference:** `dependency-graph/RUNTIME_PLANE_CONSTITUTION.md`

### 5.2 Platform Federation Constitution
- **Governs:** Inter-instance communication, data sharing, and federated identity.
- **Key Principle:** Federation must not bypass runtime governance or compromise instance sovereignty.
- **Reference:** `dependency-graph/PLATFORM_FEDERATION_CONSTITUTION.md`

### 5.3 Version & Patch Governance
- **Governs:** Semantic versioning, patch types, and update compatibility across all layers.
- **Key Principle:** Capability semantics must be preserved across updates.
- **Reference:** `dependency-graph/VERSION_EVOLUTION_AND_PATCH_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.md`

### 5.4 Feature Entitlement & Activation
- **Governs:** Feature tiers, module activation, and subscription-based access.
- **Key Principle:** Entitlement logic belongs in the Runtime Plane, not in capability layers.
- **Reference:** `dependency-graph/FEATURE_ENTITLEMENT_AND_MODULE_ACTIVATION_MODEL.md`

### 5.5 Structural Enforcement Protocol
- **Governs:** Issue titling, labeling, and automated validation to maintain structural integrity.
- **Key Principle:** Enforcement relies on GitHub labels as the primary discriminator for layer identity.
- **Reference:** `ISSUE_STRUCTURAL_ENFORCEMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

## SECTION VI — AUTOMATED GOVERNANCE VALIDATION ENGINE (AGVE)

The **Automated Governance Validation Engine (AGVE)**, also known as the **Autonomous Constitutional Drift Sentinel**, is the supreme constitutional governance sentinel for the WebWaka platform. It is established by `dependency-graph/AUTOMATED_GOVERNANCE_VALIDATION_ENGINE_MODEL.md` and its authority supersedes all other layers and planes.

**Core Principle:** AGVE validates only. It **MUST NOT** modify issues, auto-close issues, or auto-edit governance. It may only report and trigger a constitutional freeze.

| Validation Domain | Scope |
|---|---|
| Structural Validation | 128 structures × 29 issues = 3,712 invariant |
| Governance Corpus Validation | 22 required documents + Master Document synchronization |
| Runtime Structure Validation | 14 runtime structures × 29 issues |
| Federation Compliance Validation | Version compliance, entitlement boundaries |
| Version Compatibility Validation | Cross-layer version inheritance rules |
| Entitlement Boundary Validation | Feature activation and access control |

**Drift Classification:**

| Level | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Informational | Log only |
| 2 | Warning | Generate warning report |
| 3 | Structural Risk | Generate high-priority report |
| 4 | Constitutional Breach | **Trigger Freeze — apply `governance:freeze-candidate`** |

**AGVE v1.1 — Activation Discipline Validation (Section XI):**

AGVE v1.1 closes the dynamic governance gap by adding 8 activation discipline checks:

| Check | Violation Level |
|---|---|
| DAT required for `state:activated` | Level 4 |
| Phase synchronization floor enforcement | Level 3–4 |
| Cross-domain activation isolation | Level 4 |
| Freeze state blocks all transitions | Level 4 |
| Runtime binding requires activation | Level 4 |
| Entitlement compliance on activation | Level 3–4 |
| Vertical stack completeness before activation | Level 4 |
| State transition audit trail | Level 3–4 |

**Reference:** `dependency-graph/AUTOMATED_GOVERNANCE_VALIDATION_ENGINE_MODEL.md`

**AGVE Operational Execution & Certification Protocol:**

The `AGVE_EXECUTION_AND_CERTIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md` operationalizes the AGVE by defining the mandatory invocation and certification process. No activation is constitutionally valid without a **Full Platform Certification** — a PASS across all 7 validation domains — followed by explicit Founder clearance.

| Certification Level | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Structural Certified | Structural Integrity PASS |
| Governance Certified | Governance Corpus Integrity PASS |
| Activation Certified | Activation Discipline PASS |
| **Full Platform Certified** | **All 7 domains PASS — required for activation** |

**Reference:** `dependency-graph/AGVE_EXECUTION_AND_CERTIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`

## SECTION VIII — GAD-01 Organelle Canonical Expansion Amendment (2026-02-22)

**Amendment Authority:** Founder (webwaka007)
**Amendment Date:** 2026-02-22
**Reference:** `dependency-graph/ORGANELLE_CANONICAL_EXPANSION_AMENDMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

A post-certification audit (FARA-02) identified 4 AI-native organelle structures in `webwaka-organelle-universe` that were not present in the canonical governance registry. The Founder has authorized their formal ratification under GAD-01. The following amendments are hereby declared:

### 8.1 Canonical Layer Code Registry Amendment

The `ORGL` layer code is amended to recognize the `ORGN-` prefix as a valid, specialized prefix for AI-native organelles.

| Governance Layer Code | Layer | Structural Prefixes | GitHub Label |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ORGL` | Organelle | `ORG-` (standard), `ORGN-` (AI-native) | `layer:organelle` |

### 8.2 Canonical Structure Registry Amendment

The Organelle count in Section IV is amended from 18 to 22.

- **Organelle (22):** 18 standard `ORG-` + 4 AI-native `ORGN-`. See `doctrine/ORGANELLE_IMPLEMENTATION_STANDARD.md` and `dependency-graph/ORGANELLE_CANONICAL_EXPANSION_AMENDMENT_PROTOCOL.md`.

### 8.3 AGVE Structural Validation Amendment

The AGVE structural invariant for the Organelle Layer is amended:

| Validation Domain | Previous Invariant | Amended Invariant |
|---|---|---|
| Organelle Layer | 18 × 29 = 522 | **22 × 29 = 638** |

The global stack invariant (128 structures / 3,712 issues) is unchanged. The 4 AI-native organelles are tracked as an addendum to the Organelle Layer.

### 8.4 Amended Document Registry

This amendment adds one new canonical governance document:

25. `dependency-graph/ORGANELLE_CANONICAL_EXPANSION_AMENDMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

It details core design principles like versioning, multi-tenancy, and authentication via JWT tokens, along with rate limiting and offline-first support. The document provides comprehensive endpoint definitions for authentication, user management, role management, events, and synchronization, including request/response examples for both REST and GraphQL. Finally, it defines a standardized error handling format and lists the next steps for implementation.",

All 77 unit tests passed without failures, demonstrating strong test reliability and quality. While most components show excellent coverage, specific uncovered lines in `query-interceptor.ts`, `tenant-context.manager.ts`, and `tenant-validator.ts` are identified for coverage in Week 18. The next steps include aiming for 100% coverage, conducting integration tests, and performing performance tests.",
